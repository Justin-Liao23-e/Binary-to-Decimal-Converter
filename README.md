## Binary-to-Decimal-Converter (including decimal points)

A complex machine that converts between binary base and decimal bases (including infinite decimal places). 
You will be prompted to convert either way and include decimal place conversion or not depending on your preference.
This was my first project created around 2021. It was created alongside with binary-to-octal converter and binary-to-hexadecimal converter.

**To run the file**: `python 2-10decimal.py`
